How do you even show your face among such beauty?”\nThe sparrow smiled and said, “Feathers don’t make a bird great, my friend — wings do.”\nThat afternoon, heavy rain poured from the sky. The peacock’s heavy feathers got soaked, and he could not fly to shelter. The little sparrow, light and quick, flew up to a dry branch and stayed safe.\nWhen the rain stopped, the peacock looked up and said, “Now I see — bright feathers can’t help in a storm.”\nThe sparrow chirped kindly, “Every gift has its time to shine.”",
